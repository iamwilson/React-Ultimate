setState - async
state - local state of the component, cannot be accessed & modified outside the component. only be used & modified inside the component.
props - make components reusable. gives components ability to receive data from parent component in the form of props.
shallowCopy - points to the same location in memory as source
deepCopy - points to a different location in memory, but the contents are the same.

controlled Component 
 - takes its current value through props and notifies changes through callbacks like onChange. 
 - A parent component handles the callback and manages its own state 

uncontrolled Component
 - stores its own state internally
 - you query the DOM using a ref to find its current value.
 
Redux - used to sync state with server

this keyword - in JavaScript, class methods are not bound by default.

Redux Thunk - When an action creator returns a function, that function will get executed by the Redux Thunk middleware
Any time you attempt to dispatch a function instead of an action object, Redux Thunk middleware will call that function 
with dispatch method itself as the first argument.

props.children --> can be used to access not just properties but anything wrapped in between the element tags
You can pass events as props to other components
